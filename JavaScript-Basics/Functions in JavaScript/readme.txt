Here are 20 function-related coding exercises for beginners to practice and better understand the concept of functions in JavaScript:

1.Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

2.Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the length of the string.

3.Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

4.Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the string in reverse.

5.Write a function that takes an array of strings as a parameter and returns the concatenated string of all elements in the array.

6.Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the highest number in the array.

7.Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns a new array with all the numbers doubled.

8.Write a function that takes an array of strings as a parameter and returns a new array with the length of each string.

9.Write a function that takes two strings as parameters and returns true if the two strings are anagrams (contain the same letters but in a different order), otherwise false.

10.Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if it is even, otherwise false.

11.Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns a new array with only the even numbers.

12.Write a function that takes a sentence as a parameter and returns the number of words in the sentence.

13.Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the product of all the numbers in the array.

14.Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the number of vowels in the string.

15.Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if it is a prime number, otherwise false.

16.Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns a new array with the numbers sorted in ascending order.

17.Write a function that takes two arrays as parameters and returns a new array with the elements of both arrays combined.

18.Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns true if it is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise false.

19.Write a function that takes an array of strings as a parameter and returns a new array with the strings sorted in alphabetical order.

20.Write a function that takes a sentence as a parameter and returns the sentence with all the words capitalized.
